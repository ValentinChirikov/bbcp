This is the **OFFCIAL** bbcp repository based on the one previously located at https://github.com/bbcp/bbcp.git which no longer exists.

Currently, we do not supply binaries. However, it is trivial to build them yourself:

1) Optionally, create a top level directory such as "bbccp.git" and cd into it.
2) Execute git clone https://github.com/bbcp/bbcp.git
3) cd into "bbcp/src"
4) make

The executable will appear in the parent directy under the bin/_platform_directory_.

So, for instance on almalinux8, it would be "bin/amd64_linux/bbcp"
